# The data source:
All data used in this repository is obtained from World Bank, which is an open source.

# The code:
The source code for transferring data from Python to MySQL can be found in the file 'Code _ Import table to MySQL.py'. It's not guaranteed that you can run the code :P
Obviously because I've modified the file path, AND, I've crossed out the server I used to connect Python to MySQL (e.g: the server name and password).
Regardless, the idea is still there so if you know how then you know how. It is what it is.

The source code for creating the corresponding table in SQL can be found in 'Create table _ Integration with Python.sql'.
I purposely leave this file as an SQL file instead of a CSV file so that you can download it and run it on your own SQL server.
Do note that the syntax of your SQL server may be different so you may need to modify the code.

# The output:
Basically, I want to know the GDP as well as the GDP per capita of the country of interest.
I want to visualize the data using Tableau but that isn't the focus of this repository since we're transferring data, in the form of CSV file, from Python to MySQL server.
Using the source code in Python, I'll transfer the following file to MySQL server:
- 'Country and country code.csv'
- 'Female population.csv'
- 'GDP listing by year and country.csv'
- 'Male population.csv'
I also create two additional tables / dataframe in Python, which are 'Gender ratio f2m.csv' and 'Total population.csv'. These 2 tables are transferred to MySQL server as well.
But why didn't I just download the population data from World Bank? 'Cuz I don't want to, I'll just sum up the male and female population to get the total population.
Of course, not misgendering or being a gender study professionals, I'll just assume that there are male and female for the sake of simplicity.

P/S: to be honest, initially I wanted to see if there's a correlation between GDP and gender ratio. But after visualizing the data with Tableau, I found it inconclusive
or unrelated, unless maybe breaking down the data set to more categories like high income group vs low income group.
